Spanish-Jewish folklore recounts that Adam’s first wife, Lilith, became a black vampire cat, sucking the blood from sleeping babies. This may be the root of the superstition that a cat will smother a sleeping baby or suck out the child’s breath.
Approximately 24 cat skins can make a coat.
Many Egyptians worshipped the goddess Bast, who had a woman’s body and a cat’s head.
